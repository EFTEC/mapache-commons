# Mapache Commons
It's a set of useful functions for PHP. The name is a pun (Mapache in spanish is "raccoon")

## Goals

It's a set of useful function with the next requirements:
* The function mustn't have dependencies (unless it requires a php module).  
* The function must be FAST and memory friendly over the syntax sugar.
* The function must be able to run statically and it must be self contained.
* The function must be generic and it must solve generic problems.  For example, a function that calculates the VAT of a specific country is not allowed.
